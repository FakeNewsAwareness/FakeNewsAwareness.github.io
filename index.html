    <h1>Fake News Awareness</h1>
    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Our names are Michael Lin, Erik Scarlatescu, and Joshua Mabry. We are a group of high school students dedicated to raising awareness about the spread of fake news and how to combat it. In the future, this website will have resources for fact checking online arguments and provide insight into how to think critically about news. We will also be documenting our experience attempting to propagate fake news and what mechanisms are most effective.</p>
